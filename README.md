# Godot's 2D Game Demo remaked
Dodge the Creeps remaked with my style for practice purposes :)  
>If you're new to using Godot and happens to stumble upon this, 
I'd really appreciate it if you check it out, you can probably 
learn something new from it too :)

>Also, feel free to contact me through instagram (check profile) ;)  
I'm looking forward to meet a fellow programer to learn from and code stuff together.
